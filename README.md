To run the code, first copy the file `config-sample.js` and rename it to `config.js`. 
Make sure you fill in your Twitter credentials and change your cookie secret :)

Then `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm start` or `npm start-script prod` 
depending on if you want a development or production environment.
